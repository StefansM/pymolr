## Pymolr

Pymolr is an R package for using [PyMol](https://www.pymol.org/) commands
from R. It can be used to embed publication-quality molecular images into
documents produced by [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/).

### Usage

See the included [vignette](vignettes/using-pymolr.md) for usage information.

Pymolr relies on the packages
[sys](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sys/index.html) and
[XMLRPC](http://www.omegahat.net/XMLRPC/). Note that XMLRPC is not available on
CRAN, and must be installed via Omegahat. The Omegahat repository can be added
to R with the command `options(CRAN = c(getOption("CRAN"),
"http://www.omegahat.net/R"))`.

### Development

The full list of PyMol methods, along with the associated documentation, is
generated by the script `scripts/pymol_dump.py`. See `build.sh` for an example.
